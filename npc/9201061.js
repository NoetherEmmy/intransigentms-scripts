But you don't have to calculate it yourself -- just type\r\n#e@absolutexprate#n in the chat.\r\n\r\nAnd, in case you do die...\r\nSome of your #eabsolute EXP multiplier#n is actually retained across lives. If \"deathLevel\" is the level you died at in the life before this one, then your absolute EXP multiplier is #bas if#k you were level\r\n\r\n\t#eceil(deathLevel / 2) + 9#n\r\n\r\n...if that level is higher than what you're at now.");

On the other hand, if a monster is below your level you start to lose some of your EXP.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for fighting monsters that are lower in level than you decreases as you level up, and disappears by the time you are level 110. To make all of this math a bit easier, we have a few commands:\r\n\r\n\t#e@monsterlevels#n - Displays all monster types and their levels that are on your map, along with the EXP multipliers you get for each.\r\n\r\n\t#e@monstersinrange <levels below> <levels above>#n - Displays a list of monsters close to your level (within the range specified), sorted by their EXP/HP ratio, taking into account all of the math.");
